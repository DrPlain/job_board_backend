# Job Board Backend

Welcome to the **Job Board Backend** project! This is a powerful, real-world backend system designed to power a job board platform with robust role management, efficient data retrieval, and seamless API integration with modern backend development practices.

## Project Overview

The Job Board Backend is a case study in creating a scalable, feature-rich backend for a job board platform. It powers job postings, user applications, and advanced search functionality while ensuring security and performance. With comprehensive API documentation and a modular design, itâ€™s built to integrate seamlessly with any frontend.

## Project Goals

- **API Development**: Deliver a robust set of APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.
- **Access Control**: Implement secure, role-based authentication for admins and users.
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimize job search with indexing and tailored query performance.

| **Git flow**     | Version control strategy        |

## Key Features

### Authentication
- Secure registration and login with JWT authentication for `job_seeker`, `employer`, and `admin` roles.

### Job Posting Management
- APIs to create, update, delete, and retrieve job postings.
- Categorize jobs by industry, location, and type (e.g., full-time, remote).

### Role-Based Authentication
- **Admins**: Manage job listings, categories, and oversee platform operations.
- **job_seekers**: Apply to jobs, track applications, and explore opportunities.
- **employers**: Post jobs, update application status and retrieve all jobs they posted

### Optimized Job Search
- Lightning-fast filtering with database indexing.
- Search by location, category, or custom criteria with optimized queries.

### Email notification
- Asynchronous emails triggered by application submission and acceptance, powered by Celery and Redis.

### Pagination
- Efficient list retrieval with configurable page sizes for jobs and applications.

### Containerization
- Docker Compose setup with PostgreSQL, Redis, Django, and Celery services.

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests ensuring reliability.

### API Documentation
- Fully documented endpoints using Swagger.
- Accessible at `/api/docs` for easy frontend integration.
